            <p>TweetMachine started 2 or 3 years ago when I wanted to reuse an old laptop.
For one reason or another (lack of tools, lack of parts, forgetting about it)
it sat on my "open projects" self through 2 moves. Last week, though, it
occured to me that I had acquired the last piece of hardware I needed and
hadn't realized it. So, it was time to finish the project and make room on the
projects shelf.</p>

<p>The device is basically a slightly deconstructed laptop in a shadow box frame
running a custom Twitter client. What follows are the details so you can build
your very own TweetMachine!</p>
<h1>Hardware</h1>
<p>First thing, the screen needs to be separated from the bottom half of the
laptop enough so that it can be easily manipulated. In my experience there is
only one main cable connecting the base to the screen and it connects through
one of the hinges. By taking apart the screen first you should be able to see
this.</p>
<p>In the Dell Inspiron I was dealing with there were two metal hinges that ran
along the screen from top to bottom to keep the screen stiff and restrict
movement. Those needed to be removed so that the screen could go back as far
as I needed it to. After the hinges were removed I put the screen back
together.</p>
<p>To suspend the laptop in a way that would work within the shadow box I decided
to mount it to pegboard. This is the piece that took the most time to figure
out. What I settled on was using plumber's strap to make brackets. Each
individual bracket isn't very strong, but by distributing the weight of the
laptop between 6 or 8 of them things were stable.</p>

<p>The laptop fit snugly in the frame, but I was concerned about overheating so I
cut a vent with a Dremel and a hole for the power cable. The back board for
the frame also worried me, so I cut out most of the center and left only
enough of a frame to secure the laptop.</p>

<p>Originally I had planned to use a nice photo matte to cover up the rough edges
and only reveal the screen. But after putting it together with and without
that set up, it felt less interesting with it. Cara convinced me it looked
cooler without the matte, so I left it just like that.</p>
<h1>Software</h1>
<p>I installed the latest long term release of Ubuntu and configured it to start
without requiring you to log in. (This is normally a bad idea, by the way.) I
then needed to unlock the keyring automatically so that it could connect to
the wifi without you needing to type in your password. (Again, a bad idea
normally.) Next I installed unclutter, which automatically hides the mouse
cursor. I disabled the screensaver among other power management tweaks.
Finally, in power managment, I configured the power button to shut the
computer down (without asking) whenever it was pressed.</p>
<p>The end result is a laptop that will start up, log in, and connect to the wifi
without intervention. Even better, when you press the power button again it'll
shut itself down.</p>

<p>I wanted a twitter client with no branding and a simple but attractive
interface. Twitter's API is pretty easy to work with so I decided to write one
myself. With Adobe Air, I was able to easily make a full screen app with no
window controls.</p>
<p>The app supports following one user's timeline and a pre-specified search. By
left clicking anywhere in the app it'll toggle between the two modes. (The
left mouse button is easily accessible from the back of the device.)</p>
<p><strong>Quick styling note:</strong> I was using pretty light colors as the background for the app. But, once I finished putting it together and put it in my living room I noticed how the terrible viewing angle of the laptop screen washed out the colors. My solution was to bump up the saturation of the blue and purple quite a bit. Looking at it straight on you see really bright colors, but anywhere else in the room you see the colors as I was originally picturing them.</p>
<p>Finally, the last piece was to configure my app to start whenever I logged in.</p>
<p>You can grab the code here: <a href="https://github.com/doowttam/TweetMachine">https://github.com/doowttam/TweetMachine</a> It
won't win any code design awards, but it's simple and runs smoothly.</p>
<p><strong>Quick note about OAuth:</strong> Twitter moved to OAuth recently for user authentication. This is great for users but can be annoying for developers. Luckly though, Twitter allows you to shortcut the OAuth process if you're the developer of the app. For simplicity I went this route and hard-coded the access keys. This does mean, though, that the app can only work with one user's timeline.</p>
<h1>Future Improvements</h1>
<p>I'd love to have more control over the app remotely. So, I'm planning on
running a light webserver and webapp that'll allow anyone connecting to it
within my apartment to tweak the setttings and change the search term. Right
now the search is hard-coded and although it's easy to change, it requires
SSHing into the machine and restarting the app.</p>
<p>I'd also like to have the app expand links and show videos (muted) and images
that people link to. I don't think it'd be too hard and would really increase
the interesting-ness of the appliance.</p>
